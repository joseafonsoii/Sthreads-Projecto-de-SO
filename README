For Instructors:

Use "make student-dist" to generate a distribution without the
solutions.

For part 1, consider having the students write a design and submit
that before the code.

Because students may need to update their Makefile.ins (for example,
when adding new source files), they need access to a working version
of automake. As of 1/17/2004, spinlock and coredump have automake-1.5,
which is broken enough that we can't easily suport it. So the latest
automake/autoconf has been installed in
/cse451/projects/tools/bin. The autoreconf script in that directory
has also been hacked to force the use of those tools.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
To build from CVS:

Generating the configure script requires the following packages:
  autoconf >= 2.57
  automake >= 1.6
  libtool >= 1.5

On CSE grad workstatsions, run (the env variables are required):

export AUTOCONF=autoconf-2.57 AUTOHEADER=autoheader-2.57
export AUTOMAKE=automake-1.7 ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.7
aclocal-1.7 && autoheader-2.57 && automake-1.7 -a && autoconf-2.57
